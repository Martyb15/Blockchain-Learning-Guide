# Blockchain-Learning-Guide

This repository is a beginner-friendly collection of small Python examples that explain core blockchain ideas one concept at a time. 

## Teaching goal
The material is designed to help students build intuition first: 
- short script,
- one key concept per file,
- visible outputs students can inspect,
- low theory overhead.

## Recommended learning path (pacing)
1. 'hash.py' - what a hash is and why tiny input changes matter.
2. 'block.py' - a block as a data + timestamp + hash fingerprint.
3. 'chain' - how blocks link via 'previous_hash'.
4. 'detect_tampering.py' - integrity checks and tamper detection.
5. 'transactions.py' - modeling transfers as structured records.
6. 'balances.py' - state transitions and insufficient-funds checks.
7. 'proof_of_work.py' - mining puzzle and difficulty.
8. 'reward.py' - block reward and incentive design. 
9. 'signatures.py' - ownership, authenticity, and non-forgeability.
10. 'proof_of_stake' - - PoS as an alternative consensus model. 
11. 'peer_to_peer' - node communication and propagation ideas.
12. 'rest_api.py' - exposing blockchain behavior through an API.
13. 'escrow.py' - smart-contract-like conditional transfer.
